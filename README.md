## My process
I first got all the HTML all laid out and split it into sections. I then completed the styling as best as I could from the desktop preview going with a desktop focused approach first. Once that was all completed, I worked on making it responsive with a media query to help scale the content down and remove some of the padding.


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow
- 
### What I learned

I learnt to apply my layout skills on a larger scale than the previous projects. I also made this site more resposive than my previous ones applying the media queries. I learnt that I am able to make a responsive design and create some good layouts.

### Continued development

Continue to apply responsive design better from the start as I did need to go back and fix some of that once I had begun to work on the media queries and realise there were better ways to do so.
